# am4space_outgassing
Note: This reposistry is in the early stages of development

## Project Outline
Additive manufacturing (AM) offers substantial benefits to astronomical instrumentation design, particularly in optimizing geometry for reduced mass and heat transfer applications.  However, uncertainty over material properties can hinder its usage.  

This project, a part of the wider UKATC AM4Space research program, seeks to characterize the outgassing properties of structural materials in a way which is useful to design engineers.

This reposistry contains the MATLAB code used to capture and store data, calculate outgassing results, and visualise results.

## Publications

A discription of our experimental method and first results were presented at the [2022 SPIE conference](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12188/121882I/Outgassing-properties-of-additively-manufactured-aluminium/10.1117/12.2627331.full?SSO=1)
